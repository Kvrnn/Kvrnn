### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

~~I am Kevin and I have a passion for computers, both on the hardware and software level. I am currently a college student and although I am currently broke, I aspire to make a career in the field of computing. I have experience working with Javascript, particularly in backend applications, APIs, and databases. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in my field.~~ - ChatGPT

My name is Kevin and I am a broke college student who aspires to make that batch script money. I mess with apis, mongodb and nodejs. Add me on [discord](https://discordapp.com/users/264799632918446081) to discuss potential mlm schemes. If you are a potential employer, ignore that last part and enjoy my mess of repos. Have fun! - Kevin
